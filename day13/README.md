# Day 13

Step 1: Part 1 find lowest multiple between int and int ints in array
Step 2: Do that but related to each other.

1. Install nodejs
2. Run `node index` (you'll have to change your values to use the ones for your account)

NOTE: technically the JS code will eventually find the answer, but just use the ruby code from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem#Ruby and verify your answer with JS using BigInt
