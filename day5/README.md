# Day 5

Step 1: Take a list of strings and convert that to a row number and seat number using binary sorting
Step 2: Find the 1 missing number in the middle of the results of "seat IDs" and that's your seat

This puzzle is essentially managing binary sorting. I do a really poor job of explaining this so read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning and it might help â€“ it did for me :)

1. Install nodejs
2. Run `node index` (you'll have to change your values to use the ones for your account)
